### Slack Bot Challenge

[design doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RzONrzadTjaG7FcdniHlznlAbxoFhIieIu7GxrHhjtM/edit)

This app allows a Slack user to create GitHub issues using the slash command **/issue** followed by the issue's text.
Issues are hardcoded to be posted to [this repo](https://github.com/clairemuller/slack_bot_issues).

To add the app to your workspace, follow this [link](https://slack.com/oauth/authorize?client_id=715164813648.717869221283&scope=commands) and enter your workspace URL.
You might need to login and then allow the app to access your workspace. You should then be redirected to a page that says 'slack bot added!'
